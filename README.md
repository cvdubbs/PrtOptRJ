The quant analyst technical assesment project!

**There are three steps to this project:**

1. Data Validation - We explore the DataSets provided and identify errors.
2. Data Cleaning - We fix the errors, add in missing information and prep the dataset for use.
3. Portfolio Optimization and Data Output - This is the workhorse of the project. We optimize the three portfolios using our asset data and output the csv file.
